To use this blog application, first you need to install the required dependencies by running npm install in your terminal. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the server by running node app.js or npm start.

Then, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the homepage of the blog. From there, you can click on the links in the navigation bar to visit the about, contact, and compose pages.

To create a new blog post, click on the “compose” button in the navigation bar and fill out the form. Once you submit the form, your new post will be added to the homepage.

If you want to customize the blog, you can edit the EJS templates in the views/ directory or modify the routes in app.js. The Lodash library is used for some basic data manipulation, so you can use its methods to further customize the blog.
